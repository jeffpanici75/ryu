[feature/tools] IDE UI & related tasks
--------------------------------------
- UPDATE: README.md

- REFACTOR: use pratt parser model to completely replace shunting-yard implementation

- NEW: implement ability to redirect to new or appended text file in core::console

- FIX: pick_list drop down needs to paint opaque
    - after testing this, the issue is that the drop down portion if draw earlier than
      other views and they're overlapping this region.
    - possibly make the drop down part another view that's always sorted last?

- NEW: create either a state for a common dialog or a special kind of thing the engine knows as a "dialog"
        that sits atop other states, draws a frame; header; buttons; etc.  and content can be any
        dock_layout_panel.

- NEW: mouse event bindings ----
    which button?
    bounding rectangle --or-- the filter callback could check this given mouse x/y position in event_data_t

- NEW: raise error dialog where applicable

- FINISH: machine_editor::controller:
    - add component callback
    - edit component callback
    - delete component callback

- NEW: component_editor::controller
    - create a view YAML file for the layout
    - implement button callbacks

- NEW: create new core::notification_center that encapsulates observers and the observed
        - refactor core::project into this model
        - helpers to send notifications
        NOTE: inspiration here was from NSNotificationCenter in Cocoa

- NEW: create new ide::project_editor::controller
    - create project_editor.yaml view file
        - state_header
        - project header information
        - project files (column_pick_list)
        - button panel for add/edit/remove/clear files

- NEW: using new dialog system, create ide::project_jump::controller
    - create project_jump.yaml view file
    - new data structure needed here, MRU for files on project
    - might be new views required here, not sure

- NEW: column_pick_list enhancements ---
    1. fix whitespace/padding issues
    2. render footer with size indicators, e.g. page x of y, row z, etc.
    3. add support for type-ahead search
    4. page up/page down input_actions

- NEW: ide::palette_editor::controller
    1. need new palette_entry_view:

         +---------------+
         | color swatch  | R: ___  G: ___ B: ___ A: ____
         +---------------+

    2. need new palette_view. this is a multi-column layout of palette_entry_views.
    3. create palette_editor view YAML file
    4. need to get parameters for palette from the machine's video generator IC
            use an interface?  core::video_generator, IC implements this interface
                                  - where in the memory map do these go?
                                  - palette definitions
                                  - tile definitions
                                  - sprite definitions
                                  - background definitions
                          also core::sound_generator, IC implements this interface

- NEW: ide::tile_editor::controller (does both sprites and tiles)
    1. need new tile_editor view:  width, height, position, fat pixel size
    2. need tile_selector view: width, height, position
    3. need to render samples of the tile
    4. need palette_selector/entry_selector views

- NEW: ide::actor_editor::controller
    1. need tile_layout_editor view
    2. need a time line/frames view: add, edit, remove frames
    3. need a play/stop/restart button for animations
    4. generates assembly include, manually specify memory map location for .org

- NEW: ide::background_editor::controller
    1. need tile_selector view: how do we choose which tile banks to use?
    2. need scrolling layout view
        - core::video_generator tells us background definitions

- FINISH: ide::memory_editor::controller

- NEW: ide::preferences::controller
    1. create preferences.yaml view file
        - maybe use core::notebook to break up sections
        - reuse palette editor views to allow customization of IDE and emu palettes
    2. input bindings

[feature/tools] Emulator IDE
----------------------------
- NEW: emulator::service::controller
    1. create service.yaml view file
    2. dip switches
    3. high scores
    4. other persistent data?
    5. sound testing

    1. implements the core::video_generator interface
    2. OpenGL based implementation for backgrounds, tiles, sprites
    3. shader for palettes

- NEW: integrated_circuit subclass for joystick

DONE
----
- create new struct that packages up source text/stream to parse, chunked lines, and formatted lines
- core::environment now has fields for core::command_parser and core::evaluator and optimized assignment of
  symbol table and assembler pointers to these instances.
- OFFSTREAM: categorize help and ordering so they're consistent
- OFFSTREAM: added @[.b|.w|.dw] for peek
- OFFSTREAM: added ^[.b|.w|.dw] for poke
- OFFSTREAM: implemented core::environment::fill_memory
- implement a target command so that assembly isn't necessarily required
- implement help [cmd] detail variant
- implement core::environment::on_read_binary_to_memory
- OFF STREAM|FIXED: fmt::format should recognize our custom types because we have a std::ostream operator<< override.
                    however, it isn't working the way I'd expect, so need to research.
                    SOLUTION: was missing #include <fmt/ostream.h>
- OFF STREAM|FIXED: core::console now formats styled text correctly!
- OFF STREAM      : more behavior in console is now optional and activated by using the @| operator
- OFF STREAM      : added @> and @>> redirection operators to console commands

- implement core::environment::on_search_memory
- implement core::environment::on_memory_map to dump
  out the memory map of the active machine
- OFF STREAM|FIXED: BUG: parser is skipping first character of identifier
                           EXAMPLE: set debug true
                           NOTE: looks to be related to the text "debug"; not sure why
                           RESULT: parser is seeing "ebug"
- OFF STREAM      : when switching env, actually assemble file
- OFF STREAM      : implement edenv command

- core::formatted_text_t vs core::attr_span_t
- refactor console's write_message to remove "code" lookup
- BUG: how to handle gap piece between end of piece table and far new offset
- OFF STREAM      : MISSING: swap_deleted_node needs to fix-up line head/tail pair
- BUG: document rendering doesn't work with horizontal scrolling
- BUG: inserting at the head of a line appears to be broken
- BUG: inserting into the middle of a line is broken
- BUG: table formatting for header appears to be one character off

- encapsulate current SDL_Event data into our own data structure and update interface
- filter out non-ASCII characters during input
- joystick events
- joystick hat motion is a bitmask: 0 for centered
    * need to track continuous state for each direction bit, toggling the bits for events that come in
    * return true/false based on the continuous state per joystick
- preferences: key binding data structure and implementation
    - add serialization/deserialization code to input_action & input_binding so we can write to preferences.yaml
- consolidate each state's header view into one new state_header view

        add core::preferences* preferences() accessor to context.h
- fix text_box event handling
