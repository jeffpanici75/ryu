IDE UI & related tasks
----------------------

- refactoring/consolidating the attr_chunk_t/attr_chunks & text_formatter::formatted_text_t/formatted_text_span_t
  to one interface so all UI elements using document work the same way.

  nicer model and api.

- implement marks in document and surface in console & text_editor for quick navigation

- figure out how to surface errors & other messages for display in editors, e.g. source_editor, memory_editor.

- implement the memory_editor controller & view.  need a listener interface on memory_mapper that notifies registered
  listeners that memory has changed.

- implement remaining memory commands in core::environment

- implement full & correct machine editor interface

- implement full & correct project editor interface + shortcut selection UI

- implement palette editor

- implement tile/sprite editor

- implement integrated_circuit subclass for midway_mcr_video_generator that displays background map of tiles &
  foreground layer of sprites, controller initially through memory_editor & commands

- implement integrated_circuit subclass for joystick input

- implement dip_switch subclass for integrated_circuit

DONE
----
- create new struct that packages up source text/stream to parse, chunked lines, and formatted lines
- core::environment now has fields for core::command_parser and core::evaluator and optimized assignment of
  symbol table and assembler pointers to these instances.
